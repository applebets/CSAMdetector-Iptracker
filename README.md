# CSAMdetector-Iptracker
A private research toolkit for automated CSAM intelligence — including torrent swarm monitoring, NSFW content detection, perceptual hash matching, and GUI-based workflows. (Strictly for academic and lawful investigative use.)

# Warning:
Not all sites behave the same. Some, like LimeTorrents, include features that make scraping significantly more difficult. However, most of the magnet sites we plan to target do not use these protections, so we should be fine.

Proxy/VPN detection
Ethical Safeguards
Tested only on legal NSFW datasets
Never automated or deployed publicly
Intended as a conceptual framework for use only under supervision of authorized bodies

Future Directions
Collaborations with law enforcement
